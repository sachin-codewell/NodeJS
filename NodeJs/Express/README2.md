MVC Architecture

Monolithic Architecture - 

A monolithic architecture is a traditional software architecture pattern where all the components and modules of an application are tightly integrated and packaged together as a single codebase. In a monolithic application, the entire software system, including the user interface, application logic, and data storage, is combined into a single executable or deployable unit. 
Characteristics- Single Codebase, Tight Integration, Single Deployment Unit, Scalability Challenges.
Drawback- Limited Scalability, Complexity, Risk of Failure, Difficult Testing and Debugging.
Limited Agility: Monolithic applications can be less agile when it comes to rolling out updates or adding new features. The entire application needs to be redeployed even for minor changes, which can slow down the development process. 

Microservices Architecture- 

Microservice architecture is a modern software architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable, and independently scalable services. Each service in a microservices-based application represents a specific business capability and operates as a self-contained unit, communicating with other services through well-defined APIs.
